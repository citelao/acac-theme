# ACAC Theme

You might need to `npm install; bower install` to get everything working.

Based off of Sage/Roots theme.

Please don't use without permission.

## Usage

It assumes you have a static front page. It does not show any content from the
main WYSIWYG editor, instead showing all the sections from the form that appear
beneath it.

Create registration and callback pages yourself. See ACAPLUGIN for details.
