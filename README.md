# ACAC Theme

You might need to `npm install; bower install` to get everything working.

Based off of Sage/Roots theme.

Please don't use without permission.

## Usage

This theme **assumes you have a static front page**. It does not show any content from the
main WYSIWYG editor, instead showing all the sections from the form that appear
beneath it. If you haven't set this up properly, the theme will tell you how to fix it.

This theme also **has a nav menu**. This menu only appears on pages (not the front page). The theme will not warn you if there is no nav menu, it just won't show anything. To add one:

1. Open up a page (while logged in).
2. Click **Customize**.
3. Open **Menus**.
4. **Add a menu**. Name it whatever you like. **Create Menu**.
5. **Add Items** until you're satisfied.
6. Under **Display Location**, select **Primary Navigation**.
7. **Save & Publish**.

This theme finally **includes a sidebar**. This is shown at the bottom of every page (including the front page) on the site. To modify it:

1. Open up a page (while logged in).
2. Click **Customize**.
3. Open **Widgets**.
4. Customize to your heart's content.
5. Click **Save & Publish**.

Create registration and callback pages yourself. See ACAPLUGIN for details.
